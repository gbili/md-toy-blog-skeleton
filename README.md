# Md Toy Blog Skeleton

If you want to use `md-toy-blog` as an npm module, you can have a look at this one for reference.
Or you can simply _fork_ this repo and add your blog posts to the `content` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/md-toy-blog-skeleton.git
npm i
npm run build
npm run serve
```

After these commands your blog should be available in your browser at [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100) of course you will need to place some of your own markdown posts in the `content`'s directory, and remove the sample ones.
